#  CoX (Copilot for Xorg)

CoX (Copilot for Xorg) is an experimental project that brings a true "copilot" experience to your Linux desktop by leveraging the MPX (Multi-Pointer X) feature of the Xorg window system. CoX enables intelligent Computer Use Agents to run alongside you, interacting with your desktop as independent usersâ€”moving their own cursors, clicking, typing, and automating tasks in real time, right next to you.

## Setup

Add this to `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules`:
```
KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"
```
Then reload:
```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

Then add your user to `input` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
newgrp input
```


## TODO:

- [X] Script to create a master pointer and attach a uinput device to it
- [X] Add keyboard support
- [X] Basic CU agent loop script (full screen)
- [X] Single window support
- [ ] Refactor code for better maintainability
- [ ] Beautiful UI (window selection + prompt)
