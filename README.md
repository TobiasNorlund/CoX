# UI Act

UI Act is a Linux desktop (aka computer using) agent that can perform tasks just like you would do them - by interacting live with your desktop GUI.

UI Act can work along side you using its own separate mouse and keyboard. It uses Multi-Pointer X (MPX), supported by the X windowing system, to interact with open windows on your desktop. This allows for a _true_ copilot experience where you and your agent can work side-by-side to get things done:
