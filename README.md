#  CoX (Copilot for Xorg)

CoX (Copilot for Xorg) is an experimental project that brings a true "copilot" experience to your Linux desktop by leveraging the MPX (Multi-Pointer X) feature of the Xorg window system. CoX enables intelligent Computer Use Agents to run alongside you, interacting with your desktop as independent usersâ€”moving their own cursors, clicking, typing, and automating tasks in real time, right next to you.
